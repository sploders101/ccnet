# ccnet

## Description
CCnet is an http-based networking server for sploders101's "endernet" API
This api is designed for use within the minecraft mod "computercraft" to allow for limitless communication between in-game computers, as well as out-of-game computers. This can allow for interfacing with IoT devices and other applications, in addition to standard computer-to-computer in-game communication. To help with this, I do plan on creating a websocket handler to integrate and make web applications with this API much easier in the next update. An example of this use case could be with servers, such as my discord bot which listens for me to say a song name in chat and plays it in the discord server.

## Why?
1. Infinite Range
2. Cross-server communication
3. Cross-dimensional communication
4. JS api coming soon for web-apps
